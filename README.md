Simulating a complex process like a distillation column in MATLAB and visualizing the dynamic changes in concentrations would be quite insightful.
However, creating a fully detailed and accurate simulation of a real-world petroleum refinery distillation column is a significant undertaking that goes beyond a simple interaction. It typically involves:
- **Detailed thermodynamic models**: Accurate vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data and models are crucial for predicting component behavior at different temperatures and pressures. These models can be quite complex and specific to the petroleum fractions being separated.
- **Column hydraulics**: Considerations of vapor and liquid flow rates, pressure drops, tray efficiencies, and flooding/weeping phenomena are essential for a realistic simulation.
- **Feed characterization**: A thorough understanding of the composition and properties of the crude oil feed is necessary.
- **Control systems**: Real distillation columns employ sophisticated control loops to maintain desired product purities and operating conditions.

Given these complexities, a truly representative simulation would require extensive data and specialized knowledge in chemical engineering and petroleum refining.
However, I created a simplified conceptual model of a distillation column in MATLAB to illustrate the basic principles and generate some representative plots. This simplified model will make several assumptions to keep the scope manageable.

### 1. Simplified Column Diagram:

Imagine a vertical cylindrical column with multiple theoretical stages (trays) stacked on top of each other.

#### Parameters (for a conceptual petroleum refinery scenario):

- **Number of Theoretical Stages (N)**: Let's say 10 for simplicity. In reality, this can be much higher.
- **Feed Stage**: Let's assume the feed enters at stage 5.
- **Feed Composition**: A binary mixture for simplicity:
- **Component A** (Light, more volatile): Initial concentration z<sub>A​</sub>
- **Component B** (Heavy, less volatile): Initial concentration z<sub>B</sub>​=1−z<sub>A​</sub>
- **Feed Rate (F)**: A constant flow rate.
- **Reflux Ratio (R)**: The ratio of condensed liquid returned to the top of the column to the top product withdrawn.
- **Relative Volatility (α)**: A measure of the difference in vapor pressures between the two components. A higher α indicates easier separation. Let's assume a constant $α > 1$.
- **Holdup per Stage**: The amount of liquid and vapor held on each stage. For simplicity, let's assume constant holdup.



### 2. Conceptual Model (Simplified Mass Balances):

We can write simplified mass balances for each component on each stage. Let:

- L<sub>n</sub>​ be the liquid flow rate leaving stage n.
- V<sub>n</sub>​ be the vapor flow rate entering stage n.
- x<sub>n,A</sub>​ be the mole fraction of component A in the liquid on stage n.
- y<sub>n,A</sub>​ be the mole fraction of component A in the vapor entering stage n.
- Assume constant molar overflow (equal molar flow rates of liquid down and vapor up the column).

The vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) can be approximated by a simple relationship using the relative volatility:

$$y_{n,A} = {​αx_{n,A} \over {1 + (α−1)x_{n,A}}}$$

A simplified dynamic mass balance for component $A$ on a generic stage $n$ would look something like:

$${d(H_Lx_{n,A}) \over dt} = L_{n+1}x_{n+1,A} + V_{n−1}y_{n−1,A} - L_nx_{n,A} - V_ny_{n,A} + F⋅z_A⋅δ_{n,feed stage​}$$

where $H_L$ is the liquid holdup per stage, and $δ_{n,feed stage}$​ is the Kronecker delta (1 if $n$ is the feed stage, 0 otherwise). Similar equations can be written for component $B$.
At the condenser (top):

$${d(H_Cx_{N,A}) \over dt} = V_Ny_{N,A} − L_{ref}x_{N,A} − Dx_{D,A​}$$

where ${H_C}$ is the condenser holdup, $L_{ref} = R⋅D$ is the reflux flow rate, and $D$ is the distillate (top product) flow rate. We can assume $x_{D,A} ≈ x_{N,A}$​ for simplicity.
At the reboiler (bottom):

$${d(H_Rx_{1,A}) \over dt} = L_2x_{2,A} − V_1y_{1,A} − Bx_{B,A} + F \cdot z_A \cdot \delta _{1,feedstage}$$

where $H_R$​ is the reboiler holdup, and $B$ is the bottoms product flow rate. We can assume $y_{1,A}$ is in equilibrium with $x_{1,A}$ and $x_{B,A} ≈ x_{1,A}$.

### 3. Assumptions

* **Simplifications:**
This code makes significant simplifications:
    * Binary mixture.
    * Constant relative volatility.
    * Constant molar overflow.
    * Ideal stages (100% efficiency).
    * Simplified dynamics.
    * Euler integration method (for simplicity, more accurate methods exist).
* **Parameter Values:** The parameter values are arbitrary and chosen for illustrative purposes. Real petroleum distillation columns have highly specific parameters.
* **Units:** Ensure consistency in units throughout the simulation.
* **Steady State:** The initial conditions are a rough guess and the simulation will show how the concentrations evolve over time from this initial state.

### 4. Conceptual Plots:
Running a more sophisticated simulation (or even this simplified one) would typically yield the following types of time-varying graphs:

* Liquid Mole Fractions on Each Stage vs. Time: We would observe that for the lighter component (A):
    * The concentration of A in the liquid phase would be highest at the top of the column and lowest at the bottom (reboiler).
    * Over time, if the column is operating correctly, these concentration profiles would tend towards a steady state.
    * If there are disturbances (e.g., changes in feed composition or rate), we would see transient changes in the concentrations before a new steady state (or an unstable condition) is reached.
* Vapor Mole Fractions Entering Each Stage vs. Time: Similarly, for the lighter component (A):
    * The concentration of A in the vapor phase would be highest entering the condenser (top of the column) and lowest entering the reboiler (bottom).
    * The trends over time would mirror those of the liquid concentrations, with the vapor compositions being richer in the more volatile component at each stage due to vapor-liquid equilibrium.
* Top and Bottom Product Compositions vs. Time:
    * The mole fraction of the lighter component (A) in the top product (distillate) would ideally be high and move towards a desired setpoint.
    * The mole fraction of the lighter component (A) in the bottom product would ideally be low and move towards its desired setpoint.

#### Moving Towards a More Realistic Simulation:

To create a more realistic simulation for a petroleum refinery distillation column, we would need to incorporate:
* **Multicomponent VLE**: Use appropriate thermodynamic models (e.g., Raoult's Law with activity coefficients, Peng-Robinson equation of state) to accurately predict vapor-liquid equilibrium for the complex mixture of hydrocarbons in crude oil.
* **Tray Efficiency**: Account for the fact that real trays do not achieve perfect equilibrium. Use empirical correlations or more complex models for tray efficiency (e.g., Murphree efficiency).
* **Hydrodynamic Models**: Include pressure drop calculations and consider the impact of vapor and liquid flow rates on column performance.
* **Detailed Feed Characterization**: Represent the crude oil feed as a mixture of pseudo-components with their boiling point distributions and other relevant properties.
* **Control Systems**: Model the level controllers, reboiler duty control, reflux control, and other control loops that are essential for stable operation.
* **More Advanced Numerical Methods**: Use more robust numerical solvers for the differential equations to ensure accuracy and stability of the simulation.

Building such a detailed simulation typically requires specialized software like Aspen Plus, HYSYS, or CHEMCAD, which have built-in thermodynamic property databases and unit operation models.

While the simplified MATLAB code provides a basic illustration of the dynamic behavior, a real petroleum refinery distillation column simulation is a much more involved process.
